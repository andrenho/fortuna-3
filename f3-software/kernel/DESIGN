Pre-operations (BIOS):

1. BIOS is loaded at 0x0, and the Z80 starts running at 0x0
2. BIOS loads KERNEL at 0xFD00 and jumps to it. KERNEL is free to override BIOS area.

Operating system (KERNEL):

1. Setup environment: stack, interrupt table
2. KERNEL loads SHELL
3. KERNEL offers the following system calls:
  a. load application (restore stack, replaces SHELL)
  b. finalize application (restore stack, replaces application with SHELL)
